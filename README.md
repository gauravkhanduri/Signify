# Team Charizards - ASL Google Search Extension 🔍

## Track: Best Hack for Social Good - *Signify*

---

## Project Idea

**What if you could talk to Google with just your hands?**  
No typing, no clicking, no yelling "OK Google!" across the room.  
We built a **Google Chrome Extension** that recognizes **American Sign Language (ASL)** using your webcam and turns it into **automatic Google searches**.

It’s like charades — but smarter, and with results.

## Objective

> **To help differently-abled individuals surf the web without typing or pressing Enter.**  

Because inclusion isn't just cool — it's necessary.

## How It Works

### Tech Stack

| Layer      | Tools Used                     |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| Frontend   | JavaScript, HTML, CSS          |
| Backend    | Python, Flask                  |
| AI Model   | MediaPipe (Hand Detection), KNN|
| Communication | WebSocket                   |
| Data       | Custom ASL dataset             |

### Methodology

1. **Preprocess** custom ASL dataset (because good data = happy AI)
2. Train the model using **MediaPipe** for hand landmark detection
3. Use **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for recognizing signs
4. Build a **Chrome extension** that captures your hand signs via webcam
5. Detected words are automatically searched on Google

Yup, it’s basically giving your browser **sign language superpowers.**

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

- Single-hand ASL gesture recognition
- Real-time webcam capture
- Instant Google search triggered by signs
- Works inside Chrome with no extra downloads

---

## Future Plans

We're just getting started. Coming soon:

- **Double-hand gesture recognition**
- Training with **full ASL dataset**
- Turn search results into **audio output** (for blind + mute users)

Accessibility just got an upgrade.

## Big Questions?

1. What if signs are ambiguous?  
   → KNN + smoothing filters to the rescue!

2. Can this go mobile?  
   → Definitely. We’ve got our sights on that too.

3. Is it fast enough?  
   → Like a cheetah on Red Bull (yes, it's real-time).

## Why It Matters

Typing is easy for many of us. But for those who communicate through ASL, web search can be a hurdle.  
With this extension, we’re making the internet more **inclusive**, **fun**, and just a bit **magical**.

Because the web should be for **everyone** — including the hands that speak.
